One day, I woke up, found I forget everything before yesterday. I felt strange that here are some unknown technology in my head. But no matter life is going on. I continue to lived as common people not thing specially. It's upexpected that my neighbor Who is a beautiful weman was in the same case sa me.

Because of the memory loss, I had the reson to approach my 'new' neighbor. I even had a date with her, so sometime I think memory loss was not a too bad thing in some case. But, I would never thought that a man will soon came to out city and broken my clean life.

Sometime I often felt someone stare at me, when I look back or look around not thing special. When I went out with my neighbor now my girl friend, I often saw a man in black always pretended to saw the landspace. Maybe, I should do thing, in case the most worse situation arise. In follwing days, I met a cup poisonous tea, a fatat arrow which just wanted to kiss my heart and a bank robbery. It's no doute that someone want to kill me, I remembered those unknown technology in my head and tried to use it to protect myself. In my basement, I tried made a electromagnetic gun which I think it is enough to kill the killer. unluckly, the killer went in front of me, him decide to kill me directly. In the evening, I still in the basement to made the gun, a man with a mask came to my basement and shot me. Then his took off the mask who's face was as the same as my, smiling to me.

To attend a vocational college or university? This is the question, athough it is never a dilemma like Hamlet ever faced. Since, graduated from middle school, These students are facing to choose a high school. Two chooses, one is vocational college, anthor is university. In my view, it better to go to university.

I know many student prefer to student in a vocational college because it has less press and easier to graduate. What's more, vocational school can teach you a skill which they can live on it. Also, it's tuition cheaper then university's. Why I think should go to campus. First of all, what you can learn from class is different between the two. yse of cause, vocational college can teach you a living skill, but time is changing, you don't when your skill will become useless. So, you should learn how to learn new things, this is what university could give you. What else? I think the teacher who you will meet is anthor reason to study in university. In university, most of the teacher is doctor, and you will learn a lot from them.

It's better to choose university.
